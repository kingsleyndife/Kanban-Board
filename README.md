# Kanban-Board
The Kanban Board web app helps an organization track the progress of different projects. It has three types of users: Manager, Admin, and Developer. Each user has access to different features based on their role. The app was built using Pythonâ€™s Django framework, making it easy for teams to manage projects and keep things organized.
